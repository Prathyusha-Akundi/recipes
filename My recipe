The watercress sauce used to flavor these sweet potatoes is a twist on classic Argentinian chimichurri sauce, which calls for parsley.
Chimichurri

    1 ½ cups packed, trimmed watercress sprigs
    2 green onions, thinly sliced (¼ cup)
    3 Tbs. vegetable oil
    2 Tbs. lemon juice
    1 Tbs. chopped fresh marjoram
    1 clove garlic, peeled
    ¼ tsp. red pepper flakes

Stuffed Sweet Potatoes

    4 medium sweet potatoes or yams
    4 oz. plain goat cheese, softened
    2 ½ Tbs. unsalted butter or margarine, softened, divided
    ⅓ cup finely grated Romano cheese, optional
    6 oz. Broccolini, cut into 1-inch pieces

1 To make Chimichurri: Purée all ingredients in mini food processor until smooth. Season with salt, if desired. Let stand at room temperature while potatoes cook for flavors to develop.

2 To make Stuffed Sweet Potatoes: Position oven rack in middle and lower sections of oven and preheat to 450°F. Pierce potatoes several times with a fork, and put directly on middle rack. Place sheet of foil on lower rack to catch any juices. Bake potatoes for 35 to 45 minutes, or until tip of sharp knife inserted into centers pierces easily.

3 Meanwhile, whisk together goat cheese and 2 Tbs. butter in medium bowl until fluffy. Whisk in Romano cheese. Season with salt and pepper, if desired. Set aside.

4 Melt remaining ½ Tbs. butter in large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add Broccolini, and sauté 1 minute. Add 2 Tbs. water, and cook 4 minutes more, or until Broccolini is crisp-tender. Season with salt and pepper, if desired. Set aside.

5 Cut potatoes lengthwise almost to opposite ends. Using fingertips, push short ends toward center to open potatoes. Partially mash potato centers with fork. Drizzle 1 Tbs. Chimichurri over Potatoes, then top with 2 Tbs. cheese mixture, then Broccolini, then more Chimichurri and cheese mixture.
